        <p>Ghana, country of western Africa, situated on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea. Although relatively small in
            area and population, Ghana is one of the leading countries of Africa, partly because of its considerable
            natural wealth and partly because it was the first black African country south of the Sahara to achieve
            independence from colonial rule.</p>
