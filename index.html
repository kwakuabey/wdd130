            <p>My name is Bright Abbey. I am 6.8 ft tall and live in Ghana with my small but wonderful family of
                two. Growing up
                in Ghana has given me a deep appreciation for culture, community, and resilience.

                I enjoy spending time with my family, playing football, and exploring the outdoors. I also love watching
                documentaries,
                especially those that focus on nature, history, and scienceâ€”because I believe learning never ends.

                At the moment, I am learning software development with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer. I
                enjoy solving
                problems, creating new things, and constantly pushing myself to grow. My dream is to combine my
                creativity and technical
                skills to build applications and websites that can make peoples lives easier.

                Beyond technology, I am passionate about personal growth, teamwork, and making a positive impact in the
                community around
                me. I believe in working hard, staying humble, and always looking for opportunities to learn.

            <p>Ghana, country of western Africa, situated on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea. Although
                relatively small in
                area and population, Ghana is one of the leading countries of Africa, partly because of its
                considerable
                natural wealth and partly because it was the first black African country south of the Sahara
                to
                achieve
                independence from colonial rule.</p>
